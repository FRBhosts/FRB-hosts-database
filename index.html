							<p>
								The goal of this database is to provide an up-to-date overview of currently known FRB hosts. This is a compilation of FRB hosts reported in the literate in addition to new host galaxy identifications and measurements provided by the Fast and Fortunate for FRB follow-up team. <br>
								Motivation: Brief intro on FRBs. Still most constraints from host properties. Easy to look up, plot and compare various FRB host galaxy properties. <br>
								Acknowledge this work: XX ref. or terms of use: 1) cite the original observational papers of the data you used, 2) for the compilation and new measurements cite XX, and 3) add a footnote to the the webpage FRBhosts_whatever.org <br>
								We appreciate any comments on the webpage and contents. Please also feel free to send info about your new FRB hosts if it, for some reason, is not included yet.
